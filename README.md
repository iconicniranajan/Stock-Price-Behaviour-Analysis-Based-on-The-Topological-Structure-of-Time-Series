Topological data analysis (TDA) is a recent and fast-growing field providing a
set of new topological and geometric tools to infer relevant features for possibly
complex data. It proposes new well-founded mathematical theories and computational tools that can be used independently or in combination with other
data analysis and statistical learning techniques. Under TDA, persistence
homology plays a major role in our study. Our utmost goal is to read time
series behavior through topological structures in a quantitative manner. Thus,
we used persistent homology, the idea behind persistent homology is finding the
core topological features of our data that are hopefully robust to noise. For
example, we know that the simplest polygon we can construct is the triangle,
using triangles we can define any other polygon like a square consisting of two
triangles, and a pentagon can be constructed using four triangles so on and so
forth. So, if we analyze this idea more deeply, we can break down such polygons
into several triangles, which is the core of that particular shape, likewise, this
is what persistence homology does, however, most data are inherent with multidimensional properties in a complex manner so two-dimensional triangles are
not enough. To overcome this issue mathematicians came up with a generalized
version of a triangle to any number of dimensions, namely “simplexes”, and the
collection of simplexes is called ”simplicial complex” and this is the key idea in
persistent homology, the required proofs and mathematics behind this technique
are presented by many authors in many books.
The stock market is a crucial platform for companies and investors to buy and
sell financial instruments, making it essential for profit-making and dividend
generation. Major stock markets worldwide, including the Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE) in Sri Lanka, record data on company stocks and financial bonds.
It has 323 listed companies representing The CSE has 290 listed companies representing 20 business sectors as of 30 June 2019, with a market capitalization
of 30,941 million US dollars. The CSE also oversees compliance through a set
of rules, promotes standards of corporate governance among listed companies,
and is actively involved in educating investors. In the course of its operations,
the CSE interacts with many customers and stakeholders which include issuers
(such as companies, corporations, and unit trusts), commercial banks, invest
ment banks, fund managers, stockbrokers, financial advisers, market data vendors, and investors.
This research uses TDA and machine learning to analyze the behavior of stocks
in the CSE, focusing on five sectors: banking, finance, hospital, hotel, and insurance. Identifying topological structures that can be used to analyze data
behavior within the stock market, and comparing their pictorial characteristics
are the objectives that are sought to achieve through this research. To exploit
the complex topological and geometric structures underlying data often represented as point clouds in Euclidean or more general metric spaces. As in the
explanation of the given example, we found some core topological structures of
the CSE for the selected sectors. further explanation is given in the methodology. This analysis employs persistent homology, Principal component analysis
(PCA), hierarchical clustering, and Wasserstein distance to provide an in-depth
analysis of stock market behavior and find the unique patterns of the stocks,
aiding companies and investors in data-driven decision-making.
